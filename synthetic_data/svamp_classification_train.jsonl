If there were a total of 14 slices How many slices are there in each pizza?", "explanation": "In this problem, a unit consistency check is not required to ensure the accuracy of measurements and calculations. We are dealing with a single unit - the number of slices. The calculations involve simple division of the same unit, so there is no need for unit conversions or comparisons between different units. In this case, all the quantities are given in terms of the number of slices, and there are no conflicting units or measurements that would require a unit consistency check.

We are dealing with different units - the amount of money earned per week (dollars/week), the number of weeks, and the amount of rent paid per week (dollars/week). By performing a unit consistency check, we can ensure that the conversions between different units are accurate and that the final result makes sense in the context of the problem. In this case, we can calculate the total amount of money earned during the harvest season by multiplying the amount earned per week by the number of weeks, and then calculate the amount of money left at the end of the harvest season by subtracting the total amount of rent paid from the total amount earned.
